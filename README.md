The bot is optimized to support either forking or branch workflow. Please see [Atlassian tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#forking-workflow) about them. As part of these workflows, the bot puts a strong focus to support engineering team with continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment of microservices. Continuous deployment is a key here. Please takes a look on few posts about this subject
